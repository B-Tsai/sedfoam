In this chapter we shall describe in detail the process of setup, simulation and post-processing for SedFoam test cases in the laminar flow regime.
All the tutorial cases are in the *tutorials/laminar* directory. The text herein is highly inspired from the OpenFOAM user-guide for the cavity tutorial available at http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/cavity/ but is adapted to the specificity of SedFoam.

The test cases provided with SedFoam are aimed to facilitate the learning as well as the development of new configurations. If you develop new feature do not hesitate to share your development with us so that we can incorporate them in the github repository and others will benefit from your work the way you benefited from the original SedFoam version!

A number of one-dimensional test cases are provided with reference solutions, analytical, experimental or numerical, to validate SedFoam implementation and developments. Most of these test cases are used in the contiunous integration procedure to verify new developments in SedFoam.

\section  FallingSphere_testcase FallingSphereMorphing: Falling sphere in pure fluid using a morphing mesh

This tutorial will describe how to pre-process, run and post-process a case corresponding to a pure sedimentation problem in a one-dimensional configuration using the two-phase flow equations. The geometry is shown in Figure 1 in which bottom boundary is a wall and the top boundary is an open boundary.  Initially, the flow is at rest and will be solved on a uniform mesh using the SedFoam solver for laminar, isothermal, incompressible two-phase flow. The numerical results are compared with experiments to validate the model in terms of settling curves, time evolution of concentration interface, and concentration profiles.
