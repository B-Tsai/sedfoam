In this chapter we shall describe in detail the process of setup, simulation and post-processing for SedFoam test cases using dynamic meshes. All the tutorial cases are located in the *tutorialsDyM* directory.

\section  FallingSphereOverset_testcase FallingSphereOverset: Falling sphere in pure fluid using an overset  approach

In this tutorial, we study the free fall of a sphere with a diameter \f$D=15mm\f$ settling in silicon oil using the overset approach. The experimental setup consists of a rectangular box measuring  \f$100 \times 100 \times 160mm\f$ (click <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/14/11/4012/1008754/Particle-imaging-velocimetry-experiments-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext">here</a> to go to the article associated to this experiment) . The input parameters have been chosen to reproduce the experiments of a settling sphere at a Reynolds number equal to \f$Re=W^{obj}D/\nu^f=1.5\f$, where \f$W^{obj}\f$ is the terminal velocity of the sphere.   The  numerical case can be found in the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset*. This benchmark is inspired by the
<a href="https://wiki.openfoam.com/Settling_Sphere_by_Michael_Alletto">online tutorial of a settling sphere of OpenFOAM</a>. The physical parameters are summarized in  the following table:
